                            Use of Cookies
                            The Happy Sewa USA website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.

When you return to the same Happy Sewa USA website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Happy Sewa USA features that you customized.
                            
                            You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.
